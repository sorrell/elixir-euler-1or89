# Euler89

This is a series of learning Elixir through a Project Euler problem on number chains.

It starts with `euler89.ex`, then into a refactor, then into a very concise golf-like refactor `euler89_refac_golf.ex`. Finally, there is also a version that uses concurrency and spawns. All rough and probably inefficient... just learning.
